# SQLite Record Deletion Script

This repository demonstrates how to delete records from an SQLite database table using Python.

## Features

- Connect to an SQLite database.
- Fetch and display records from a table.
- Delete records based on specific conditions.
- Handle errors gracefully.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- SQLite installed (optional, if you want to manually inspect the database).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd sqlite-delete-script
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python delete_records.py
   ```

## File Structure

- `delete_records.py`: Main script to execute database operations.
- `example.db`: SQLite database file (generated when you run the script).

## Notes

- Ensure the database file `example.db` exists, and the table `users` is created beforehand.
- You can modify the table name and condition in the script as needed.
